Important SwiftUI APIs for project:
- NavigationStack: takes in a root view and a NavigationPath object which the stack responds to
- .navigationDestination(for: ..., destination: ...) : responds to a new item added to the NavigationStack's NavigationPath, if the new item matches the type specified after 'for', a jump to the destination is triggered.
