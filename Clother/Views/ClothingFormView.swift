        - Expect to receive the app's view models.
        - Build the UI. Create any necessary variables/functions.
        - Observe the UI components implemented under subviews folder. Do not reimplement a subview that has been built, use the subviews given to you as much as possible.
        - Don't forget to implement backwards navigation. Utilize the view model functions and variables for navigation. Submitting the form should take us back to the root (HomeView).
