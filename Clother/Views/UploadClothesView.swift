        - Expect to receive the app's view models.
        - Build the UI. Create any necessary variables/functions.
        - Observe the UI components implemented under subviews folder. Do not reimplement a subview that has been built, use the subviews given to you as much as possible.
        - Navigation should also work in this view. This screen can jump to a certain view as shown in Figma. Utilize the view model functions and variables for navigation. Don't forget to implement backwards navigation.
